User Flow:
- Load a song
- Press play/pause
- control stem balance
- mute/solo stems


Design:
- 4 stems
    - 2 buttons each stem = 8 buttons
    - 4 potentiometers each stem
- Play/pause button
- Load song on website -> use arduino to play -> sound comes from computer


Create a web app where users can load a song
The song will split the stems
The user can choose to play back the song on the website
or on an arduino
The user can control the stem balance

And add effects?

Basic: Arduino communicates with max to play pre-loaded stems
Advanced: Arduino communicates with serial to a python script to send values and display on front end - play audio from website
